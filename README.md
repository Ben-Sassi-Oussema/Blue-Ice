# Blue-Ice
â€‹Our idea is to create a Robot , Drone and a Submarine to collect informations (Temperature , Humidity , density of ice...) then send it to Data Base by the satellite connexion after that we will  send the information to the android application then to the smart watch to alert them from the dangers places , and the academic has the access to Data Bases.
